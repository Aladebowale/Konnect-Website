            Order Form for the Services in accordance with the terms therein
            (collectively, the “Fees”). If Customer’s use of the Services
            exceeds the Service capacity set forth on the Order Form or
            otherwise requires the payment of additional fees (per the Terms
            herein or as outlined in the Order Form), Customer shall be billed
            for such usage and Customer agrees to pay the additional fees in
            the manner provided herein. Company reserves the right to change the
            Fees or applicable charges and to institute new charges and Fees
            upon thirty (30) days’ prior notice to Customer (which may be sent
            by email); however, updated charges and/or Fees shall not go into
            effect until the Customer’s next renewal effective date. If
            Customer in good faith believes that Company has billed Customer
            incorrectly, Customer must contact Company no later than 10 days
            after Customer’s receipt of a billing statement in which the error
            or problem appeared in order to be eligible for an adjustment or
            credit upon a confirmed error.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.2 Customer is responsible for providing complete and accurate
            billing and contact information to Company and notifying Company of
            any changes to such information. Customer hereby agrees to pay all
            fees and charges assessed to Customer’s account hereunder, as
            invoiced by Company. If Company bills Customer through an invoice,
            full payment is due within thirty (30) days from the invoice date.
            Unpaid amounts are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on
            any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever
            is lower, plus all expenses of collection. Company reserves the
            right to charge interest and suspend or terminate the Services and
            these Terms due to Customer’s failure to remit timely payment

          <p>
            4.3 Unless Customer is deemed tax exempt, Customer shall be
            responsible for payment of all sales, use and excise taxes
            applicable to Fees and other services fees, including but not
            limited to, all sales, use or other taxes, which may be levied or
            assessed in connection with this Agreement. Customer shall pay such
            tax when due or reimburse Company as Company may request. Customer
            shall not be responsible for taxes assessed on Company’s net
            income, property or personnel.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Term and Termination</h2>

          <p>
            5.1 Subject to earlier termination as provided herein, this
            Agreement is for the initial period specified in the Order Form
            (“Initial Service Term”).
          </p>

          <p>
            5.2 After the Initial Service Term these Terms shall automatically
            renew for additional one (1) year periods (“Renewal Term(s)”)
            unless and until a party provides written notice at least ninety
            (90) days prior to the end of any Initial Service Term or Renewal
            Term of its intent not to renew these Terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            5.3 In addition to any other remedies it may have, either party may
            terminate these Terms upon thirty (30) days’ notice (or without
            notice in the case of nonpayment), if the other party materially
            breaches any of the terms or conditions herein. In the event of
            termination by Company hereunder, Customer will pay in full for the
            Services through the Initial Service Term or any current Renewal
            Term. In the event of termination by Customer hereunder, Customer
            shall pay in full for Services received through the effective date
            of termination. All sections of these Terms which by their nature
            should survive termination will survive termination, including,
            without limitation, accrued rights to payment, confidentiality
            obligations, warranty disclaimers, indemnification obligations and
            limitations of liability.
          </p>

          <p>
            5.4 If this Agreement is terminated for any reason: (a) all access
            rights granted hereunder shall cease on the effective date of
            termination; (b) Customer shall pay all Fees and any other fees for
            Services and all past due amounts through the date of termination
            and (c) Customer, its employees and any permitted users shall cease
            use of the Services on the effective date of termination. Each
            Receiving Party will return or destroy the Disclosing Party’s
            Proprietary Information (in the Disclosing Party’s sole
            discretion), together with any and all tangible materials and all
            copies thereof, provided, however: (i) that if a legal proceeding
            has been instituted to seek disclosure of the Proprietary
            Information, such material shall not be destroyed until the
            proceeding is settled or a final judgment with respect thereto has
            been rendered; (ii) that the Receiving Party shall not, in
            connection with the foregoing obligations, be required to identify
            or delete Proprietary Information held electronically in archive
            or back-up systems in accordance with general systems archiving or
            backup policies; and (iii) that the Receiving Party shall not be
            obligated to return or destroy Proprietary Information of the
            Disclosing Party to the extent the Receiving Party is required to
            retain a copy pursuant to applicable law, and further provided
            that the Receiving Party will not, and the Receiving Party will use
            commercially reasonable measures to cause its employees not to,
            access such Confidential Information so archived or backed-up.
